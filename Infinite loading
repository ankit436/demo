 You're correct. In this code, page 2 is indeed being called twice. This is happening due to the structure of the initial load and the subsequent preloading mechanism. Let's break down why this is occurring:

1. Initial Load:
   In the first `useEffect` hook, there's an `initialLoad` function that loads the first two pages:

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
     await loadData(i, false);
     setPage(i);
     if (!hasMore) break;
   }
   ```

   This loads page 1 and page 2.

2. Preloading:
   After the initial load, the page state is set to 2. Then, in another `useEffect` hook, there's a check for preloading:

   ```javascript
   if (shouldLoadNextPage && !preloading && hasMore) {
     loadData(page + 1, true);
   }
   ```

   Since `page` is 2 at this point, this will trigger a preload of page 3. However, it will also trigger a preload of page 2 again, because the `loadedPages` set doesn't prevent preloading of already loaded pages.

To fix this issue and avoid loading page 2 twice, you could modify the `loadData` function to check if the page has already been loaded, even for preloading:

```javascript
const loadData = useCallback(
  async (pageToLoad, isPreload = false) => {
    if (loadedPages.has(pageToLoad)) return;
    
    if (isPreload) {
      if (preloading) return;
      setPreloading(true);
    } else {
      if (loading) return;
      setLoading(true);
    }

    try {
      const newData = await fetchData(pageToLoad);
      if (newData.length === 0) {
        setHasMore(false);
      } else {
        setData((prevData) => [...prevData, ...newData]);
        setLoadedPages((prev) => new Set(prev).add(pageToLoad));
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    } finally {
      if (isPreload) setPreloading(false);
      else setLoading(false);
    }
  },
  [loadedPages, loading, preloading]
);
```

This modification ensures that a page is not loaded again, even during preloading, if it has already been loaded. This should prevent page 2 from being loaded twice.

Would you like me to explain any other part of the code or suggest any further optimizations?
