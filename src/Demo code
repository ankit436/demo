"Dear [Manager's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to share that I recently sustained an ankle injury that has led my doctor to recommend a 10-day period of rest and recovery. During this time, I kindly request the possibility of working from home to ensure I can focus on healing while still contributing to our team's efforts.

I'm committed to maintaining my productivity and keeping lines of communication open. If it would be convenient, I'd be happy to discuss the details of how I plan to manage my tasks remotely and ensure a smooth workflow.

I genuinely appreciate your consideration of this request and am grateful for your ongoing support.

Warm regards,
[Your Name
